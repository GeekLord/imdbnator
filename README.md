# IMDbnator

IMDBnator is a free, simple and easy web app to manage movies. Movies of any format like `[FOO.AgS]Batman.Begins.DVDRip.2005.www_ganool.ag` can be loaded from the computer or from a webpage and after a few seconds of processing, it catalog the entire movies collection in a beautiful and organized manner.

You can sort, search, filter, watch trailers before your next movie and more! :)
